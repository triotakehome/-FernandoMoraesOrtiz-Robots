# Robots
This repository contains the project for the Trio challenge.

Robots! is a multi-round, completely autonomous game played by two robots taking turns moving across a 7x7 game board in search of a randomly placed prize token.

The robots move randomly to find the prize, horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally. They leave a trail when they move, and can't visit a place where their own trail exists, or where the opponent's trail is. They also can get stuck, which can lead to a guaranteed win for the opponent, or even a draw! Each time one of them gets to the prize, a point is awarded and kept on the scoreboard.
